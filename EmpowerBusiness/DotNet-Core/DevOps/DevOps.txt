Interoperability with COM and .NET libraries.

3. Explain the difference between ref and out keywords.
Answer:
ref: The variable must be initialized before passing to the method.
out: The variable need not be initialized before passing to the method; 
it must be assigned a value within the method.

4. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
Answer:
Abstract Class	Interface
Can have method implementations.	
Cannot have method implementations (until C# 8.0, which introduced default methods).
Supports constructors.	No constructors allowed.
Allows access modifiers.	All members are public by default.

5. What is the difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable?
Answer:
IEnumerable: Executes queries in memory (client-side). Best for in-memory collections.
IQueryable: Executes queries on the database server (deferred execution). 
Suitable for querying large datasets.

6. What is a delegate in C#?
Answer:
A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that allows methods to be passed as parameters. 
It is used in event handling and callback mechanisms.

7. What is the difference between value types and reference types?
Answer:
Value Types: Stored in the stack. Examples: int, float, bool.
Reference Types: Stored in the heap. Examples: object, string, class.

8. What is the purpose of var, dynamic, and object?
Answer:

object: Base type for all types in C#; type-checking occurs at runtime.

9. Explain async and await in C#.
Answer:
async and await are used for asynchronous programming in C#.
async: Marks a method as asynchronous.
await: Suspends the method execution until the awaited task completes.

10. What are extension methods?
Answer:
Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying them 
or inheriting from them. They are defined as static methods in a static class with the 
this keyword.

11. Explain LINQ in C#.
Answer:
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature that provides query capabilities directly in C#.
It can be used to query collections, databases, XML, and more.

14. What is the using statement in C#?
Answer:
The using statement ensures the proper disposal of resources (like files, database connections) 
that implement the IDisposable interface.

using (var resource = new Resource())  
{  
    // Use the resource  
}  

15. Explain sealed classes and methods.

Answer:
Nullable types allow value types to represent null.
Example:
Edit
int? nullableInt = null;  

18. Explain boxing and unboxing in C#.
Answer:
Boxing: Converting a value type to an object type.
Unboxing: Converting an object type back to a value type.
Example:
Edit
int num = 5;  
object obj = num; // Boxing  
int num2 = (int)obj; // Unboxing  

19. What is polymorphism in C#?
Answer:
Polymorphism allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the context.
Compile-time Polymorphism: Method overloading.
Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding.

20. Explain dependency injection and its types.
