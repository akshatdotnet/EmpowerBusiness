6. Can you explain your experience with .NET Core and API integrations?
Answer:
I have extensive experience working with .NET Core, developing RESTful APIs, 
and integrating third-party services. My expertise includes:
Building Scalable APIs: Using ASP.NET Core Web API with best practices like 
dependency injection, middleware, and logging.
Securing APIs: Implementing JWT authentication, OAuth2, and API gateways.
Database Interactions: Using Entity Framework Core, stored procedures, 
and optimizing queries for performance.
Third-Party Integrations: Worked with APIs such as payment gateways, banking services, 
and cloud storage.
Async & Performance Optimization: Used async/await, caching, and distributed architectures 
to enhance performance.
Example: I developed a financial transaction API that integrated with a banking system, 
handling secure payments and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
