A.Basic C# Questions
1.What are the main features of C#?
Answer:
Object-oriented programming: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Type Safety: Strongly-typed language with runtime type-checking.
Garbage Collection: Automatic memory management.
Asynchronous programming: Built-in support for async/await.
LINQ: Language-Integrated Query for querying collections.
Interoperability: Works with COM components and native code.

2.Explain the concept of Managed Code and Unmanaged Code.
Answer:
Managed Code: Code executed by the CLR (Common Language Runtime). It benefits from features like 
garbage collection, type safety, and exception handling.
Unmanaged Code: Code executed directly by the operating system. Examples include code written in C/C++.

3.What is the difference between ref and out keywords in C#?
Answer:
ref: The variable must be initialized before being passed.
out: The variable does not need to be initialized before being passed, but it must be assigned 
inside the method.
Example:
void Example(ref int refParam, out int outParam)
{
    refParam += 10;   // ref variable is used directly
    outParam = 20;    // out variable must be assigned a value
}

B.Advanced C# Questions
1.What are Delegates and Events in C#?
Answer:
Delegates: A delegate is a type-safe pointer to a method. It can reference any method 
with a matching signature.
Example:
public delegate void PrintMessage(string message);

Events: Events are based on delegates and are used to enable a publisher-subscriber model.
Example:
public event PrintMessage OnPrint;
OnPrint?.Invoke("Hello, World!");

2.What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
Answer:
Feature	            Abstract Class	                        Interface
Methods	            Can have abstract and concrete methods.	Only abstract methods (default).
Fields	            Can have fields.	                    Cannot have fields.
Multiple            Inheritance	Not supported.	            Supported.
Access Modifiers	Supports access modifiers.	            Cannot have access modifiers.

Example:
abstract class Shape { public abstract void Draw(); }
interface IShape { void Draw(); }

3.What are Generics in C#?
Answer:
Generics allow you to define type-safe data structures and methods without specifying the data type 
in advance.
Example:
public class GenericClass<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
    public void Display(T input) { Console.WriteLine(input); }
}

C.Scenario-Based Questions
1.How would you handle exceptions in a C# application?
Answer:
Use try-catch-finally blocks for exception handling. For global exception handling, 
use AppDomain.UnhandledException or middleware in ASP.NET Core. 
Example:
try
{
    int result = 10 / 0;
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Execution completed.");
}

2.How would you ensure thread safety in a multithreaded application?
Answer:
Use locks with lock or Monitor:

private static readonly object _lock = new object();
lock (_lock) { /* Critical section */ }

Use thread-safe collections like ConcurrentDictionary.
Use async/await for asynchronous programming.

3.How do you handle file I/O in C#?
Answer:
Use classes from the System.IO namespace like File, StreamReader, and StreamWriter.
Example:
string content = File.ReadAllText("file.txt");
File.WriteAllText("output.txt", content.ToUpper());

D.C# Design Patterns
1.Explain the Singleton Design Pattern.
Answer:
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a 
global point of access to it. 
Example:
public class Singleton
{
    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() { }
    public static Singleton Instance => _instance;
}

2.What is Dependency Injection (DI) in C#?
Answer:
Dependency Injection is a technique where an object receives its dependencies from an 
external source rather than creating them internally. 
In ASP.NET Core, DI is built-in. 
Example:
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();

3.Explain the Observer Design Pattern.
Answer:
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship where multiple observers 
are notified of state changes.
Example:
public class Subject
{
    private readonly List<IObserver> _observers = new();
    public void Attach(IObserver observer) => _observers.Add(observer);
    public void Notify() => _observers.ForEach(o => o.Update());
}

E.Real-World Problem-Solving Questions
1.How would you implement caching in a C# application?
Answer:
Use MemoryCache or Distributed Cache:

IMemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());
_cache.Set("key", "value", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
var value = _cache.Get<string>("key");

2.How would you optimize the performance of a LINQ query?
Answer:
Use deferred execution.
Minimize in-memory operations (.ToList()).
Use compiled queries in Entity Framework.
Filter data as early as possible (e.g., before projection).

3.How would you create a REST API using C#?
Answer:
Use ASP.NET Core to create RESTful endpoints.
Implement controllers and routes:

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetUser(int id)
    {
        var user = new { Id = id, Name = "John Doe" };
        return Ok(user);
    }
}

F.Behavioral Questions
1.How do you manage version control in a team project?
Answer:
Use Git with branch strategies like GitFlow or Feature Branching. 
Perform code reviews and follow semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0).

2.How do you ensure code quality in a C# project?
Answer:
Write unit tests using xUnit or NUnit.
Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
Perform regular code reviews and use static analysis tools like SonarQube.
